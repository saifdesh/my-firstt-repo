        Medal record
        The Argentina national football team (Spanish: Selección de fútbol de Argentina) represents Argentina in men's
        international football and is administered by the Argentine Football Association, the governing body for
        football in Argentina.

        Nicknamed La Albiceleste ('The White and Sky Blue'), they are the reigning world champions, having won the most
        recent World Cup in 2022. Overall, Argentina has appeared in a World Cup final six times; a record equalled by
        Italy and surpassed only by Brazil and Germany; Argentina played in the first ever final in 1930, which they
        lost 4–2 to Uruguay. Argentina's next final appearance came 48 years later, in 1978, when the team captained by
        Daniel Passarella defeated the Netherlands 3–1 in extra time, being crowned world champions for the first time.
        Captained by Diego Maradona, Argentina won their second World Cup eight years later, in 1986, with a 3–2 final
        victory over West Germany. They reached the final once more under the guidance of Maradona, in 1990, but were
        ultimately beaten 1–0 by West Germany. A few decades later, Argentina led by Lionel Messi made their fifth final
        appearance in 2014, losing to Germany 1–0 after extra time. In 2022, again captained by Messi, they were crowned
        the World Champions for the third time, the fourth-most of any country, beating France 4–2 on penalties,
        following a 3–3 draw after extra time, hence becoming the third most successful team in the history of the FIFA
        World Cup.

        The team's World Cup–winning managers are César Luis Menotti in 1978, Carlos Bilardo in 1986 and Lionel Scaloni
        in 2022. Since the Golden Ball for tournament's best player has been officially awarded by FIFA from 1982,
        Argentina players have won it thrice; Maradona in 1986 and Messi in 2014 and 2022. Argentines Guillermo Stábile
        in 1930 and Mario Kempes in 1978 were the top-scoring players at their respective World Cups.

        Argentina has also been very successful in the Copa América, winning it 15 times, a record it shares with
        Uruguay, most recently winning the 2021 edition. The team also won the inaugural FIFA Confederations Cup in
        1992. Argentina is the most successful team in the CONMEBOL–UEFA Cup of Champions, having won it twice, in 1993
        and 2022. Argentina is known for having rivalries with Brazil, Uruguay, England, Germany and the
        Netherlands.[12][13] As of 2022, Argentina holds the record for most official titles won by a men's national
        team with 22.[14] Individually for Argentina, Lionel Messi is the all-time most-capped player with 172 games and
        the highest goalscorer with 98 goals.</p>
